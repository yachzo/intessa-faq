# intessa-faq
This is a quick and dirty plugin with a shortcode for creating and displaying questions and answers.
The input fields only show up on the faq edit page. Right now because I am kinda dumb, it identifies the page by ID.
Since the ID on localhost and live server are going to be different, the code will need to be updated from ID 111 to
ID 63. I will rewrite it with a funtion to identify ID from the slug 'faq' someday when my brain starts functioning properly.
